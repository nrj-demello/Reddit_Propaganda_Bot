This thread is my favorite as it has no connection whatsover with the original post, which is called "Yoko Kanno « Waltz in High Socks » from Cowboy Bebop" and is very chaotic because the comments are barely related to each other. It is also very long (which couldn't be captured by 1 screenshot).

## Score
I believe my score should be 18 for the for the bot.py tasks, 2 for the github repo, and 4 points in extra credit (for the 100 and 500 valid comments).
This means a total of 24 points.
